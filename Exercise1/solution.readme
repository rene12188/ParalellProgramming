What are the necessary conditions for deadlocks (discussed in the lecture) [0.5 points]?
Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode. This means that only one process can use the resource at any given time.
Hold and Wait: A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting for another resource to be freed by another process.
No Preemption: A resource cannot be forcibly taken away from a process that is holding it. It can only be released voluntarily by the process holding it.
Circular Wait: A set of processes is waiting for each other in a circular chain. For example, process A is waiting for a resource held by process B, process B is waiting for a resource held by process C, and process C is waiting for a resource held by process A.

Why does the initial solution lead to a deadlock
Because it takes the first fork and then waits for the second fork, it is possible that another philosopher takes the second fork and then waits for the first fork. This will result in a deadlock.
